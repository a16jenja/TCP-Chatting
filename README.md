# UDP-and-TCP-Chatting

This a project made in a distributed systems course.

This contains a simple chat GUI that handles sending messages by using the TCP protocol and sockets and UDP protocol between one Server and multiple clients. When typing a message it will broadcast to all users currently online in the chat. 

There are multiple commands to run which include:

* "/leave" to leave the chat
* "/tell" to private message another user that is in the chat
* "/list" to list all users currently online in the chat
